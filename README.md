# IoT Sense

## Overview

Welcome to the IoT Data Collector and Streamer project! This open-source application is designed to facilitate the collection, storage, and real-time streaming of IoT data. It connects seamlessly with a Kafka message broker to receive data, stores it efficiently in a MongoDB database, and streams the collected data to mobile applications in real time.

### Key Features

* Data Ingestion via Kafka: The application consumes IoT data streams from a Kafka broker, allowing it to handle high-throughput, real-time data from various IoT devices.
* Efficient Data Storage: Data is stored in a MongoDB database for persistence, ensuring that all collected information is safely stored for further analysis and retrieval.
* Real-Time Data Streaming: The application streams data to connected mobile applications using real-time communication protocols, ensuring up-to-date information for users and devices.
* Scalable Design: Built to handle high volumes of data and users, the application can easily scale to meet the growing needs of IoT environments.

## Architecture

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

1. Kafka Integration: This application subscribes to Kafka topics and consumes messages containing IoT data from various sources (sensors, devices, etc.).
2. MongoDB Storage: Collected data is structured and stored in MongoDB, providing both scalability and flexibility in data storage.
3. Mobile Application Streaming: Using WebSockets or other real-time protocols, the application delivers updates and notifications directly to connected mobile clients.

## Getting Started

### Overview

The application relies on some settings to run correctly and these settings are about context where the application is going to run. To allow users to customize the application, there a few settings that are needed to be set.
The application needs to be configured via following environment variables:
* `DB_HOST`: MongoDB host name
* `DB_USER`: MongoDB user credentials to login
* `DB_PASSWD`: MongoDB password to login
* `DB_NAME`: The name where the you whant store the data
* `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: The Kafka brokers base url
* `HUB_SLUG`: The name of setted Hub in platform configuration phase (see the CLI utilities [ðŸš§ Work in progress] to learn more)
* `PUBLIC_KEY_LOCATION`: The pem public file to use to validate the JWT (see the CLI utility to know how to generate it)
* `JWT_AUDIENCE`: The audience of the JWT (same used to generate the JWT with te CLI utility)

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./gradlew build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _Ã¼ber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _Ã¼ber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/iot-sense-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling>.
